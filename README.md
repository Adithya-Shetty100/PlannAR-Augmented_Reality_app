# PlannAR-Augmented_Reality_app
AR technology is used to place objects in space virtually. This app is used for planning events by placing decorations virtually.

I created a java AR app using Sceneform 1.6v apk and Android Studio 3.5.3v (Gradle 5.4.1) as a prototype for my 4th Sem CIE project. It helps users to design events using AR.
